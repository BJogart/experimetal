# this script samples random notes based on probability distributions
# distributions are conditioned on the previous note---it's basically
# a hard-coded Markov chain.

TONIC = :F4
TEMPO = 0.75
SEED = 10

# the following are hardcoded probability distributions.
# each distribution is a list of offsets from the tonic
# a note is chosen uniformly from this list, so a note
# that is repeated more often has a higher chance of
# being chosen.

# NB: these are offsets from the major scale(s); minor scales
# are based off of different offsets. each distribution also
# includes a special offset '13', which is not the 13th
# note in the scale; it is instead interpreted as a single-note
# rest. (the absence of a note.)

# distribution based on the book by Huron
