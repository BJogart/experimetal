## Sonic-Pi Music Scripts
Make sure your scripts have an **.rb** extension (not **.txt**!)
Each file should be named as follows:

```feature_type_personId_number.rb```

For example:

```rhythm_even_li_1.rb```
```pitch_c4_ja_3.rb```

|Person|Id|
|:-|:-|
|Heleen|he|
|Jasper|ja|
|Justin|ju|
|Lizzy|li|
|Okko|ok|
